## «Brain games» 

«Brain games» is a set of five console games based on the popular mobile brain-pumping apps. Each game asks questions to which you must give the right answers. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again

Games:
* Even number determination.
* Calculator. Arithmetic expressions to be calculated
* Determination of the greatest common divisor.
* Progression. Finding missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
* Determining a prime number.
